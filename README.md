# Canada-Health-Sciences-Dashboard

The attached file has three tabs of sample data (fake) for a hospital organization. I analyzed the data and relate my analysis through a well-designed, visually appealing and easy to understand dashboard.

The terms in the data are explained below:

Inpatients Tab – For reference inpatients are patients that stay in a bed in the hospital overnight.

·         Inpatient bed count = how many “heads in beds” there are in the hospital on a given day at midnight

·         Unfunded beds = how many “heads in beds” do we have beyond what we are funded for by the Ministry of Health

·         Occupancy Rate (Med/Surge) = Total bed count / funded (budgeted) beds (for only medical/surgical beds)

ED Tab – ED stands for Emergency Department

·         ED Visits = how many people visited the ED that day (24 hour period)

·         ED Admission Rate = how many people were admitted as inpatients / how many people visited the ED

·         ED Admit (no bed) = how many people should have been admitted to an inpatient bed but there were no free beds to put them in (so waiting in an ED stretcher)

 ALC Tab – ALC (alternate level of care) – these are patients that don’t need to be in hospital but they cannot be safely discharged (need to go to long-term care, complex care, etc) – these reasons have been summarized just as “designation types” and you will see that we have laid it out for the different sites that way.
